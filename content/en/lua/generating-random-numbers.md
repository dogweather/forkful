## What & Why?
Random numbers are sequences without any pattern. We use them in programming for tasks like sorting data, running simulations or creating unique IDs.

## How to:
To generate a random number in Lua, just use `math.random()`. Here's how it goes:

```lua
print(math.random()) -- generates a random number between 0 and 1
```

Want a random integer? No worries! Use `math.random(lower, upper)`:

```lua
print(math.random(1,10)) -- generates a random integer from 1 to 10 
```

Feel the need to set a seed so that random numbers aren't the same across runs? We got you covered.

```lua
math.randomseed(os.time())

print(math.random()) -- different result each run
```

## Deep Dive

Before 1951, random numbers were mainly generated by flipping coins, rolling dice, or some physical phenomena. Then the ENIAC's creators designed the first RNG - a program generating sequences simulating randomness.

In Lua, `math.random` uses a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). PRNGs don't produce truly random numbers but try to mimic the randomness. For most general purposes, they're good enough.

Alternatively, you could implement your own random number generator or use libraries like `lmrand`.
