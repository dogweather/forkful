I always liked "Cookbook"-style documentation the most.

In December 2023 I decided to make my own. I needed to know how to do
a **simple debug/print** in Haskell. But I think I'm just not
intelligent enough to understand 
[the Haskell Wiki's entry](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Debugging).

I've coded in a ton of programming languages, and I'm not looking
for a dissertation. 😅 I only wanted to see the very simplest description.
As in, 

> If you want to debug-print `x`, change it to `(trace "message" x)`.
> It will print `message` and return `x`. It's transparent to the rest
> of your code.

**That's** something my small brain can understand.

Now, is the 
[Forkful Haskell page for debug print](/en/haskell/printing-debug-output/) as
understandable? It's not as dead simple as I imagined,
but I think the me of a month ago would have understood it. I'm actively
fine-tuning my AI code.

Another thing I've always wanted to start building: web sites where every
page can be edited on GitHub.

Finally, with AI (OpenAI their API) getting so useful, I can make this site in
"all the languages". And then somehow still allow people to edit and contribute.
So far so good.
